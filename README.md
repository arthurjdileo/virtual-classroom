CMU 15-112 Term Project

Project Name: Virtual Classroom

Description & Purpose: 
My virtual classroom project intends to serve the vast community of academia by providing a platform in which teachers and students alike can share ideas not only in the confines of a physical classroom. A virtual classroom allows two or more participants to communicate and collaborate in a class-like environment to simulate an actual classroom but with much more convenience and access to learning tools. Such learning tools include the ability to collaborate via a whiteboard using Sockets and Tkinter in Python 3. In the future, I hope to add additional functionality such as an option for audio and/or video chat, and an option to upload and download files through the classroom.

Expansion Plans:
Following the conclusion of the course, I wish to expand this program to be open source and to be edited by fellow programmers with the same purpose in mind. Furthermore, I hope that I can eventually use this project to allow programmers to teach individuals in economically disadvanted areas and set-up a platform that will connect these two parties.
